In this post, I would be talking about Qt topics that I've found useful and tricky to understand. 
## Qt starting recipe
1. Include the `QApplication` or `QGuiApplication`
2. Second, We need a mainwindow, so include a `QMainWindow`

### Including .ui file:
- first read this [getting started](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/designer-using-a-ui-file.html#using-a-member-variable)
- You have basically two options:
- 1. adding `testingUI.ui` file directly into your `main.cpp` file 
    To do this, you need to write:
    ```c++
    #include "ui_testingUI.h" // not an actual header file
    int main(){
        ...
        Ui::testingUI ui;
        ui.setupUi(new Qwidget());
        ui.show();
        ...
    }
    ```
    2. Adding some code to the `.ui` file, (i.e. making it intercatible) and **then** add it to the `main.cpp` file!

### A critical Error in QT-creator
- ~~When you initialize \*\*any project\*\* in QT, there will be some errors. What you need to do is just unsetting `CMAKE_PROJECT_INCLUDE_BEFORE`. WEIRD!!!~~

### SQL databases in Qt
- Firstly read this: https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/sql-programming.html

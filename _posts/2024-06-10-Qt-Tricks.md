In this post, I would be talking about Qt topics that I've found useful and tricky to understand. 

- First thing is to include the `QApplication` or `QGuiApplication`
- Second, We need a mainwindow, so include a `QMainWindow`

### A critical Error in QT-creator
- When you initialize \*\*any project\*\* in QT, there will be some errors. What you need to do is just unsetting `CMAKE_PROJECT_INCLUDE_BEFORE`. WEIRD!!!

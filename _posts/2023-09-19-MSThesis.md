Hello, 

In this post, I'll be posting about my thesis, based on [this]() article, titled **"A conflict free branch and bound approach for scheduling AGVs in ACTs"**. 

I will be using **xpress** for solving the model and GAMS' C++ API for formulating and implementing the B&B approach.

In this page, I will store whatever I think is useful for my defense and thesis needs.

#### Useful websites:
1. cool article about Branch and Bound's concept in xpress's website: [https://www.fico.com/fico-xpress-optimization/docs/dms2019-03/solver/optimizer/HTML/chapter4_sec_section4003.html](https://www.fico.com/fico-xpress-optimization/docs/dms2019-03/solver/optimizer/HTML/chapter4_sec_section4003.html)
2. GAMS's reference for using Xpress in it: [https://www.gams.com/28/docs/S_XPRESS.html#XPRESS_USAGE](https://www.gams.com/28/docs/S_XPRESS.html#XPRESS_USAGE)
3. FICO's website, stating the solver uses b&b for solving MIP [Here](https://www.fico.com/fico-xpress-optimization/docs/latest/solver/optimizer/HTML/chapter4.html?scroll=section4003)

In this post, I'll be posting about my thesis, based on [this](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2022.107968) article, titled **"A conflict free branch and bound approach for scheduling AGVs in ACTs"**. 
This article is an important contribution to AGV-related problems because:
1. **the assumed path layout is bidirectional AND it aims to avoid congestion and conflict.**
2. The number of vertical parallel shortcuts ($$X_R$$) is **very many!** (in contrast to [this](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=XnHbS6MAAAAJ&cstart=20&pagesize=80&citation_for_view=XnHbS6MAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C))
I will be using **xpress** for solving the model and GAMS' C++ API for formulating and implementing the B&B approach.

In this page, I will store whatever I think is useful for my defense and thesis needs.

## Useful websites:
1. cool article about Branch and Bound's concept in xpress's website: [https://www.fico.com/fico-xpress-optimization/docs/dms2019-03/solver/optimizer/HTML/chapter4_sec_section4003.html](https://www.fico.com/fico-xpress-optimization/docs/dms2019-03/solver/optimizer/HTML/chapter4_sec_section4003.html)
2. GAMS's reference for using Xpress in it: [https://www.gams.com/28/docs/S_XPRESS.html#XPRESS_USAGE](https://www.gams.com/28/docs/S_XPRESS.html#XPRESS_USAGE)
3. FICO's website, stating the solver uses b&b for solving MIP [Here](https://www.fico.com/fico-xpress-optimization/docs/latest/solver/optimizer/HTML/chapter4.html?scroll=section4003)
4. For copying gams into cmake: [here](https://www.gams.com/47/docs/API_CPP_TUTORIAL.html#CPP_GETTING_STARTED)
5. In regard to GAMS 25.1 MIP implementation: [here](https://www.gams.com/25.1/docs/UG_ModelSolve.html#UG_ModelSolve_ModelClassificationOfModels_DNLP) and also [this](https://www.gams.com/25.1/docs/UG_LanguageFeatures.html#UG_LanguageFeatures_SpecialMIPFeatures)
6. This is how you might wanna define this set: <br>$$\boldsymbol{O(i, j, k) = \{(i,j,k)|\,\,\forall(i,j) \in c, \,\, k\in a\}}$$ <br>
in GAMS:
```
set i "set of all" / i1*i12 /;
set j /j1/;
set a /1,2,3,4/;
set c(i,j) /#i.j/;
set o /#c.#a/;
```
7. [NVIDIA CUDA](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/)
- It seems that according to [this](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-27679-3_3) article, there are more conflicts types, namely: **deadlocks and livelocks** (*it's good to read the review article for this purpose*)

## Gams related topics:
### Tutorial and useful links:
- [Multi-Dimensional Sets](https://www.gams.com/25.1/docs/UG_SetDefinition.html#UG_SetDefinition_Multi-dimensionalSets)
- [Comments in Gams](https://www.gams.com/25.1/docs/UG_GAMSPrograms.html#UG_GAMSPrograms_Comments): for putting an eol comment, you need to set `$onEolCom` at the start and then use `!!` to put eol comments. For a whole line comment, asterisk `*`.
  **Note** that this syntax is only used for EOL, i.e. the lines containing code, not blank lines. For inserting comments on a blank line, use `*`.
- It seems that changing a set, e.g. union of two sets, is not allowed in gams as easily as it might seem. For this purpose, you need to define **dynamic sets**! (read more about them [here](https://www.gams.com/48/docs/UG_DynamicSets.html?search=union%20of%20sets)). This is how you might have union:
``` 
set i /i1*i3/;
set j /j1*j3/;
set k;
k(i) = yes;
k(j) = yes;
```

- [GDX data exchange format](https://www.gams.com/48/docs/UG_GDX.html)
- [the `.` and `#` operator](https://www.gams.com/48/docs/UG_SetDefinition.html?search=dot%20) (note that `.` might indicate Cartisian Product if used with `()`). if it is used out of `set` operations, it would mean member accessing operator.
- writing [equations](https://www.gams.com/48/docs/UG_Equations.html#UG_Equations_Defining) in gams
- [xpress solver integration in gams](https://www.gams.com/25.1/docs/S_XPRESS.html)
- `.gdx` is the **database file format** of GAMS.
- Just use the damn `gams25UG.pdf` file, reserved words. And remember this code snippet: (**stupid language!!!!**)
```
eq_1(i,j) $(not sameas(i,'i1')).. 1 =e= 1; 
```
- Did you know that `GAMS` is not case sensitive? (because it's a terrible languagew!!)
- **Very important**: You **CANNOT** put so-called _endogenous expressions_ (the ones containing decision variables) inside `$()` conditionals. You need to write them with `$ifthen` or defining auxiliary variables and intermediatory constraints.
- You **cannot** use `$` conditionals **right after** `=e=, =l=, =g=` etc.
- To use solver-specific commands, read these two: [GAMS docs](https://www.gams.com/latest/docs/UG_LanguageFeatures.html#UG_LanguageFeatures_SpecialMIPFeatures) and [stackoverflow](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2500415/how-to-write-if-else-statement-in-linear-programming) and for [solver usage](https://www.gams.com/latest/docs/UG_SolverUsage.html) and for [gurobi option in Gams](https://www.gams.com/latest/docs/S_GUROBI.html#GUROBI_OVERVIEW_OF_GAMS_GUROBI)
- To use solver-specific commands and options, you need a `.opt` file, containing all the the additional options (in the link I provided somewhere in this post from GAMS website). To create and add the `.opt` file to your prefered solver, you need to add the following GAMS to the bottom of your code:
  ```
  *$onEcho > CFS.opt
  *iis 1
  *$offEcho
  *ConflictFreeSch.Optfile = 1;
  ```
- **Regarding Neos-server.org**: if want to add some options to your solver, [upload an option file to the server](.).
- **For Detecting conflicting constraints in your model**: You can **iis** option of the gurobi solver.
- For using **indicator constraints**, refer to [this Gams Page](https://www.gams.com/latest/docs/UG_LanguageFeatures.html) and this [stackoverflow answer](https://or.stackexchange.com/questions/10038/using-indicator-constraint-with-two-variables?newreg=34296c1f701f4b0284758a95fa60e780)

### GAMS 25.1 in QT
- As you might know, the only "stable" version of GAMS currently available with full solvers support is GAMS 25.1 \*\*for free\*\*, and hence _we are stuck with a very old (probably around 2017 verison) of GAMS_
- _Before doing anything, remember to use **BCUninstaller** to uninstall the Gams and delete its leftovers, then reinstall the 25.1 version with gamslice3.txt as the license.

- For integration of GAMS inside a QT, you need:
  - visual studio 17 2022 with all c++ sdk and MSVC sdks (The most crucial of all is **`cl.exe`**, which is a command line based MS C++ needed for `CMAKE_COMPILER_CXX` variable)
  - QT 6.7.3
- After cloning the repo I made in [here](https://github.com/amireza007/GAMS28-in-VS-2015), You need to set `CMAKE_GENERATOR` to `Visual Studio 17 2022` and unset `CMAKE_PROJECT_INCLUDE_BEFORE`. (alternatively you could set `-DCMAKE_PROJECT_INCLUDE_BEFORE=""` in Qt's `preferences->kits->The-kit->CMake Configuration`)
- Then build and enjoy coding in QT!

**ps**: you might notice a bug in your code when you `#include "gams.h"` saying: `In included file: forward declaration of class cannot have a nested name specifier
gamslib_global.h`. Simply ignore it, because it is related to `clangd`, which is a syntax highlighter thing.

## The AGV Dispatching Conflict-free Article
Enough prerequisites, let's delve into the this article:

 _A branch-and-bound approach for AGV dispatching and routing problems in automated container terminals_ **[doi: [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2022.107968](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2022.107968)]**
 * Note that time limit in the article for gurobi is **3600** seconds.
 * Also, **Handover Points (HPs)** do exist both in quay side and  yard side.

### Some important assumptions
- The AGV cannot turn multiple times in the seaside and landside operation areas. This means than AGV cannot change horizontal lanes once it is in the seaside ($$y \in \{1,\dots, y_r\}\quad  \text{or}\,\,\,\, y \in \{ y_{r+1}, \dots, y_R\}$$). **HENCE** this is where horizontal confilict occurs, since or else, the AGV would change lane if there is an AGV on the front when doing horizontal action!

### Parameters: 
So **3** types of parameters and sets are used:
- #### Main parameters: 
  These are specific to **AGVs, QCs, Containers, AGV actions**
  - there are several parameters: $$\boldsymbol{v_{AGV}}$$ (the constant speed), $$\boldsymbol{m}$$ (the index of QCs), $$\boldsymbol{i}$$ (index of i-th job of QCs), **$$\boldsymbol{\alpha}$$** (index of AGV actions)
  - There are some Sets regarding to AGVs and QC: **$$\boldsymbol{C_L, C_D}$$** (set of loading and unloading containers), **$$\boldsymbol{W^V}$$**, $$\boldsymbol{W^H}$$ (set of vertical (Horizontal) AGV Actions, $$\boldsymbol{\alpha}$$ = $$2$$($$1,3,4$$))
  - $$\boldsymbol{C = C_L \cup C_D}$$ is a **two** dimensional set of $$\boldsymbol{C = \{(m,i), m \in m, i \in i \}}$$

- #### Path Related parameters:
  These involve AGV paths:
  - parameters are: $$\boldsymbol{x_R}$$ (width of agv op), $$\boldsymbol{y_r}$$ last vertical **Landside** Area, $$\boldsymbol{y_R}$$ last **Seaside** Area, $$\boldsymbol{l}$$ (the index of AGVs), $$\boldsymbol{O_{(m,i)} \in X^R}$$ (vertical path of QC to op $$\boldsymbol{(m,i)}$$), $$\boldsymbol{A^{L(R)}_{(m,i)} \in X^R}$$ (I don't understand this! _left(Right)-most vertical path of the block that stored container $$\boldsymbol{(m,i)}$$)
  - sets are: $$Y^S$$ (seaside vertical paths), $$Y^L$$ (landside vertical paths), $$X^R$$ (Horizontal paths)
- #### Time related parameters:
  - Parameters are: $$\boldsymbol{G^Q_{(m,i)}}$$ (required time for QC to op $$\boldsymbol{(m,i)}$$), $$\boldsymbol{G^Y_{(m,i)}}$$ (required time for AGV to op $$\boldsymbol{(m,i)}$$ onto AGV-supp), $$\boldsymbol{S^Q_{(m,i),(m,i+1)}}$$ (required time for QC switch) used just in **Const(29)**. For better comprehension, take look at `QC_double_cycle.svg` in thesis folder.
  - Sets are: **$$\boldsymbol{\psi _1, \psi _2}$$** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; QC and ASC op schema (these are used in **30 and 31** const.)
  - **Very important note about $$\psi_2(m,i,n,j)$$**: the containers $$(m,i)$$ and $$(n,j)$$ belong to the same block, according to the *(iv) Time Constraint* part of the article! 

### Decision Variables:
- #### (Potentially and mostly) Conflict related Variables
  - $$\boldsymbol{Z_{(m,i)(n,j)l}}$$: it's mostly concerned with consecutive operation of AGVs $$\rightarrow$$ **QC double cycling**
  - $$\boldsymbol{U^{AGV}_{(m,i,\alpha_1)(n,j,\alpha_2)}}$$: if $$(m,i,\alpha_1) \prec (n,j,\alpha_2)$$ (conducted before)
  - $$\boldsymbol{U^{QC}_{(m,i)(n,j,\alpha)}}$$: if **Cont ($$m,i$$) of QC is conducted before H Act of ($$n,j,\alpha$$)**
- #### Path and Location Variables:
  - ##### Finish Vars:
    - $$P^X_{(m,i,\alpha),x}$$ if Finish of $$(m,i,\alpha)$$ is on $$x$$
    - $$P^Y_{(m,i,\alpha),y}$$ if Finish of $$(m,i,\alpha)$$ is on $$y$$
  - ##### Start Var:
    - $$P^X_{(m,i, 0),x}$$ if Finish of $$(m,i)$$ is on $$x$$
    - $$P^Y_{(m,i, 0),y}$$ if Finish of $$(m,i)$$ is on $$y$$
- #### Time vairables:
  - $$\boldsymbol{T^Q_{(m,i)}}$$ Start of QC Op on (m,i)
  - $$\boldsymbol{T^Y_{(m,i)}}$$ Start of AGV of putting (m,i) on ASCs
  - $$\boldsymbol{T^{start}_{(m,i,\alpha)}}$$: start of AGV to conduct act $$(m,i,\alpha)$$
- #### Auxiliary variables
  These can be written in terms of each other.
  - $$\boldsymbol{t^{\text{AGV}}_{(m,i,\alpha_1)(n,j,\alpha_2)} = \Big( \Big| X^{\text{position}}_{(m,i,\alpha_1)} - X^{\text{position}}_{(n,j,\alpha_2)} \Big| + \Big| Y^{\text{position}}_{(m,i,\alpha_1)} - Y^{\text{position}}_{(n,j,\alpha_2)} \Big| \Big) \Big/ v^{\text{AGV}}}$$ 
    <br>OR <br> $$t^{AGV}_{(m,i,\alpha_1)(n,j,\alpha_2)} = \frac{\Delta x+ \Delta y}{v^{AGV}}$$ 
  - $$\boldsymbol{X^{\text{position}}_{(m,i,\alpha)}}$$: finishing location of $$\boldsymbol{(m,i,\alpha)}$$
  - $$\boldsymbol{Y^{\text{position}}_{(m,i,\alpha)}}$$ finishing location of $$\boldsymbol{(m,i,\alpha)}$$

### Constraints in GAMS
**Important note**: Firstly, remember that the symbols in front of the article constraints are the ones appearing in the indices of the constraints of the GAMS. take look at the example below:<br>

$$\sum_{l \in B} \sum_{(n,j) \in C \cup \{0\} } Z_{(m,i)(n,j),l} = 1, \,\, \forall(m,i) \in C$$
```
cnstr_2(m,i) $(C(m,i) and not sameas(m,'m0') and not sameas(i,'i0')).. sum((li,n,j) $(C(n,j)),  z(m,i,n,j,li)) =e= 1;
```

some constraints, for example, $$\boldsymbol{eq_2((m,i))}$$ take as its counter, the *(m,i)*, but we can't set *(m,i)* as the counter, 'cause it's 2-dimensional. However, we might handle it with ***ord(C(m,i))***... idk.

<br>

  **Very important part of the article** 

- Read **6.1** of the Article, very important notes about the value of some parameters (parameter estimation) and Instance Generation (Our Data)
This part is concerned with many of the values of parameters, such as $$\boldsymbol{v_{AGV}}, S^Q_{(m,i)(m,i+1)}$$.
-  Remember for $$\psi_{2}$$, for $$(m,i,n,j)$$ being a member of it, $$(m,i)$$ and $$(n,j)$$ need to belong to the same block in the Yard side and ASC op.
<br>

- Constraint 8 in the article could be written as follows: 
    1. $$P^X_{(n,j,0)} - 10^{10}(1-\sum_{l\in B} z_{(m,i)(n,j)l}) \le P^X_{(m,i,4)}$$
    2. $$P^X_{(n,j,0)} + 10^{10}(1-\sum_{l\in B} z_{(m,i)(n,j)l}) \ge P^X_{(m,i,4)}$$
It is also worthwhile to observe that (according to previous constraints) $$\sum_{l\in B} Z_{(m,i)(n,j)l}$$ is a **SOS1** constraint.

## Unanswered questions
1. In fig. 1, are the unloading containers ($$\boldsymbol{(m,i) \in D}$$) stored in blocks in the ships? (if so, $$\boldsymbol{A^L_{(m,i)}, A^R_{(m,i)}}$$ should contain unloading containers!) 
2. How are those two sets defined for unloading containers as the layout of containers in the ships are different from the storage area?
3. Does $$O_{(m,i)}$$ map $$(m,i)$$ to **only one value**? because the m-th QC moves to different blocks of the ship it is operating on... (At least that't what seems logical to be the case!!)
4. A problematic set is $$\psi_1 = \{(m,i,n,j)| (m,i) \prec (n,j) \}$$. I am not sure whether I should be assuming that $$m\ne n$$ or $$m=n$$. However, I would be assuming $$m=n$$ since one QC's operation should not concern another one. But, if that is the case, it would be natural to question why authors did not consider the order of i-th jobs in the pair $$(m,i)$$?? I am a bit lost!!
5. Did you know that the below constraint clarifies the relationship between decision variable $$P^X_{(m,i,\alpha),x}$$ and $$t^{AGV}_{(m,i,\alpha_1)(n,j,\alpha_2)}$$? However, take note of this constraint:
<br>

$$\left( 3- U^{\text{QC}}_{(m,i)(n,j,\alpha_2)} - P^Y_{(m,i,\alpha_1),y} - P^Y_{(n,j,\alpha_2),y}+ \big| \sum_{x=1}^{O_{(m,i)}} P^X_{(n,j,\alpha_2),x} - \sum_{x=O_{(m,i)}+1}^{x_R} P^X_{(n,j,\alpha_2 - 1),x} \big| \right)M + T^{\text{Start}}_{(n,j,\alpha_2)} + t^{\text{AGV}}_{(n,j,\alpha_2 -1)(m,i,\alpha_1)} \ge T^Q_{(m,i)} + G^Q_{(m,i)}$$

Problem: both $$t^{AGV}_{(m,i,\alpha_1)(n,j,\alpha_2)}$$ and $$P^X_{(m,i,\alpha),x}$$ are here!
6. What is the definition of $$R_{(m,i)}$$ in the definition of the **upper bound algorithm**?

## Deficiencies of the base article
1. The schedule for which container should be dispatched to where is known. WHY??? As I've understood, the container i-th is known to where is should be sent (whether it being a **QC** or a **block in the Storage area**). So, the **problem of container allocation to QC or Blocks** remains open! (Could be related to integrated scheduling).
2. If with respect to **3.** in unanswered questions, $$O_{(m,i)}$$ is set to just one value, then the problem of scheduling QC container jobs for block placement on the ships *is not considered*, which is not cool!
We could add a variable denoting allowed positions of qc for its i-th container! 
3. Number of blocks on the ship and the number of ships are not considered!
4. I feel that for defining $$\psi_1$$ and $$\psi_2$$, we need to solve another optimization problem. Hence, **this might be another deficiency** too! But, I think this is where we need to use **`HCDVRP.cpp`**.
5. The **speed of AGV** is *constant*. Why can't it accelerate?? What would happen if it does?
6. This article has overlooked the AGV **charging constraints** according to [this](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.seares.2024.102536)

Hello, 

In this post, I'll be posting about my thesis, based on [this](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2022.107968) article, titled **"A conflict free branch and bound approach for scheduling AGVs in ACTs"**. 

I will be using **xpress** for solving the model and GAMS' C++ API for formulating and implementing the B&B approach.

In this page, I will store whatever I think is useful for my defense and thesis needs.

## Useful websites:
1. cool article about Branch and Bound's concept in xpress's website: [https://www.fico.com/fico-xpress-optimization/docs/dms2019-03/solver/optimizer/HTML/chapter4_sec_section4003.html](https://www.fico.com/fico-xpress-optimization/docs/dms2019-03/solver/optimizer/HTML/chapter4_sec_section4003.html)
2. GAMS's reference for using Xpress in it: [https://www.gams.com/28/docs/S_XPRESS.html#XPRESS_USAGE](https://www.gams.com/28/docs/S_XPRESS.html#XPRESS_USAGE)
3. FICO's website, stating the solver uses b&b for solving MIP [Here](https://www.fico.com/fico-xpress-optimization/docs/latest/solver/optimizer/HTML/chapter4.html?scroll=section4003)
4. For copying gams into cmake: [here](https://www.gams.com/47/docs/API_CPP_TUTORIAL.html#CPP_GETTING_STARTED)
5. In regard to GAMS 25.1 MIP implementation: [here](https://www.gams.com/25.1/docs/UG_ModelSolve.html#UG_ModelSolve_ModelClassificationOfModels_DNLP) and also [this](https://www.gams.com/25.1/docs/UG_LanguageFeatures.html#UG_LanguageFeatures_SpecialMIPFeatures)
6. This is how you might wanna define this set: <br>$$\boldsymbol{O(i, j, k) = \{(i,j,k)|\,\,\forall(i,j) \in c, \,\, k\in a\}}$$ <br>
in GAMS:
```
set i "set of all" / i1*i12 /;
set j /j1/;
set a /1,2,3,4/;
set c(i,j) /#i.j/;
set o /#c.#a/;
```
7. [NVIDIA CUDA](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/)
- It seems that according to [this](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-27679-3_3) article, there are more conflicts types, namely: **deadlocks and livelocks** (*it's good to read the review article for this purpose*)

## Gams related topics:
### Tutorial and useful links:
- [Multi-Dimensional Sets](https://www.gams.com/25.1/docs/UG_SetDefinition.html#UG_SetDefinition_Multi-dimensionalSets)
- [Comments in Gams](https://www.gams.com/25.1/docs/UG_GAMSPrograms.html#UG_GAMSPrograms_Comments): for putting an eol comment, you need to set `$onEolCom` at the start and then use `!!` to put eol comments. For a whole line comment, asterisk `*`.
  **Note** that this syntax is only used for EOL, i.e. the lines containing code, not blank lines. For inserting comments on a blank line, use `*`.
- It seems that changing a set, e.g. union of two sets, is not allowed in gams as easily as it might seem. For this purpose, you need to define **dynamic sets**! (read more about them [here](https://www.gams.com/48/docs/UG_DynamicSets.html?search=union%20of%20sets)). This is how you might have union:
``` 
set i /i1*i3/;
set j /j1*j3/;
set k;
k(i) = yes;
k(j) = yes;
```

- [the `.` and `#` operator](https://www.gams.com/48/docs/UG_SetDefinition.html?search=dot%20) (note that `.` might indicate Cartisian Product if used with `()`. if it is used out of `set` operations, it would mean member accessing operator.

### GAMS 25.1 in QT
- As you might know, the only "stable" version of GAMS currently available with full solvers support is GAMS 25.1 \*\*for free\*\*, and hence _we are stuck with a very old (probably around 2017 verison) of GAMS_
- _Before doing anything, remember to use **BCUninstaller** to uninstall the Gams and delete its leftovers, then reinstall the 25.1 version with gamslice3.txt as the license.

- For integration of GAMS inside a QT, you need:
  - visual studio 17 2022 with all c++ sdk and MSVC sdks (The most crucial of all is **`cl.exe`**, which is a command line based MS C++ needed for `CMAKE_COMPILER_CXX` variable)
  - QT 6.7.3
- After cloning the repo I made in [here](https://github.com/amireza007/GAMS28-in-VS-2015), You need to set `CMAKE_GENERATOR` to `Visual Studio 17 2022` and unset `CMAKE_PROJECT_INCLUDE_BEFORE`. (alternatively you could set `-DCMAKE_PROJECT_INCLUDE_BEFORE=""` in Qt's `preferences->kits->The-kit->CMake Configuration`)
- Then build and enjoy coding in QT!

**ps**: you might notice a bug in your code when you `#include "gams.h"` saying: `In included file: forward declaration of class cannot have a nested name specifier
gamslib_global.h`. Simply ignore it, because it is related to `clangd`, which is a syntax highlighter thing.

## The AGV Dispatching Conflict-free Article
Enough prerequisites, let's delve into the this article:

 _A branch-and-bound approach for AGV dispatching and routing problems in automated container terminals_ **[doi: [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2022.107968](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2022.107968)]**

### Parameters: 
So **3** types of parameters and sets are used:
- #### Main parameters: 
  These are specific to **AGVs, QCs, Containers, AGV actions**
  - there are several parameters: $$\boldsymbol{v_{AGV}}$$ (the constant speed), $$\boldsymbol{m}$$ (the index of QCs), $$\boldsymbol{i}$$ (index of i-th job of QCs), **$$\boldsymbol{\alpha}$$** (index of AGV actions)
  - There are some Sets regarding to AGVs and QC: **$$\boldsymbol{C_L, C_D}$$** (set of loading and unloading containers), **$$\boldsymbol{W^V}$$**, $$\boldsymbol{W^H}$$ (set of vertical (Horizontal) AGV Actions, $$\boldsymbol{\alpha}$$ = $$2$$($$1,3,4$$))
  - $$\boldsymbol{C = C_L \cup C_D}$$ is a **two** dimensional set of $$\boldsymbol{C = \{(m,i), m \in m, i \in i \}}$$

- #### Path Related parameters:
  These involve AGV paths:
  - parameters are: $$\boldsymbol{x_R}$$ (width of agv op), $$\boldsymbol{y_r}$$ last vertical **Landside** Area, $$\boldsymbol{y_R}$$ last **Seaside** Area, $$\boldsymbol{l}$$ (the index of AGVs), $$\boldsymbol{O_{(m,i)}}$$ (vertical path of QC to op $$\boldsymbol{(m,i)}$$), $$\boldsymbol{A^{L(R)}_{(m,i)}}$$ (I don't understand this! _left(Right)-most vertical path of the block that stored container $$\boldsymbol{(m,i)}$$)
  - sets are: $$Y^S$$ (seaside vertical paths), $$Y^L$$ (landside vertical paths), $$X^R$$ (Horizontal paths)
- #### Time related parameters:
  - Parameters are: $$\boldsymbol{G^Q_{(m,i)}}$$ (required time for QC to op $$\boldsymbol{(m,i)}$$), $$\boldsymbol{G^Y_{(m,i)}}$$ (required time for AGV to op $$\boldsymbol{(m,i)}$$ onto AGV-supp), $$\boldsymbol{S^Q_{(m,i),(m,i+1)}}$$ (required time for QC switch) used just in **Const(29)**
  - Sets are: **$$\boldsymbol{\psi _1, \psi _2}$$** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; QC and ASC op schema (these are used in **30 and 31** const.)

### Decision Variables:
- #### (Potentially and mostly) Conflict related Variables
  - $$\boldsymbol{Z_{(m,i)(n,j)l}}$$: it's mostly concerned with consecutive operation of AGVs $$\rightarrow$$ **QC double cycling**
  - $$\boldsymbol{U^{AGV}_{(m,i,\alpha_1)(n,j,\alpha_2)}}$$: if $$(m,i,\alpha_1) \prec (n,j,\alpha_2)$$ (conducted before)
  - $$\boldsymbol{U^{QC}_{(m,i)(n,j,\alpha)}}$$: if **Cont ($$m,i$$) of QC is conducted before H Act of ($$n,j,\alpha$$)**
- #### Path and Location Variables:
  - ##### Finish Vars:
    - $$P^X_{(m,i,\alpha),x}$$ if Finish of $$(m,i,\alpha)$$ is on $$x$$
    - $$P^Y_{(m,i,\alpha),y}$$ if Finish of $$(m,i,\alpha)$$ is on $$y$$
  - ##### Start Var:
    - $$P^X_{(m,i, 0),x}$$ if Finish of $$(m,i)$$ is on $$x$$
    - $$P^Y_{(m,i, 0),y}$$ if Finish of $$(m,i)$$ is on $$y$$
- #### Time vairables:
  - $$\boldsymbol{T^Q_{(m,i)}}$$ Start of QC Op on (m,i)
  - $$\boldsymbol{T^Y_{(m,i)}}$$ Start of AGV of putting (m,i) on ASCs
  - $$\boldsymbol{T^{start}_{(m,i,\alpha)}}$$: start of AGV to conduct act $$(m,i,\alpha)$$
- #### Auxiliary variables
  These can be written in terms of each other.
  - $$\boldsymbol{t^{\text{AGV}}_{(m,i,\alpha_1)(n,j,\alpha_2)} = \Big( \Big| X^{\text{position}}_{(m,i,\alpha_1)} - X^{\text{position}}_{(n,j,\alpha_2)} \Big| + \Big| Y^{\text{position}}_{(m,i,\alpha_1)} - Y^{\text{position}}_{(n,j,\alpha_2)} \Big| \Big) \Big/ v^{\text{AGV}}}$$ 
    <br>OR <br> $$t^{AGV}_{(m,i,\alpha_1)(n,j,\alpha_2)} = \frac{\Delta x+ \Delta y}{v^{AGV}}$$ 
  - $$\boldsymbol{X^{\text{position}}_{(m,i,\alpha)}}$$: finishing location of $$\boldsymbol{(m,i,\alpha)}$$
  - $$\boldsymbol{Y^{\text{position}}_{(m,i,\alpha)}}$$ finishing location of $$\boldsymbol{(m,i,\alpha)}$$

## Constraints in GAMS
some constraints, for example, $$\boldsymbol{eq_2((m,i))}$$ take as its counter, the *(m,i)*, but we can't set *(m,i)* as the counter, 'cause it's 2-dimensional. However, we might handle it with ***ord(C(m,i))***... idk.

## Very important part of the article: 
- Read **6.1** of the Article, very important notes about the value of some parameters (parameter estimation) and Instance Generation (Our Data)

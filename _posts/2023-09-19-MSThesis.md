Hello, 

In this post, I'll be posting about my thesis, based on [this](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2022.107968) article, titled **"A conflict free branch and bound approach for scheduling AGVs in ACTs"**. 

I will be using **xpress** for solving the model and GAMS' C++ API for formulating and implementing the B&B approach.

In this page, I will store whatever I think is useful for my defense and thesis needs.

#### Useful websites:
1. cool article about Branch and Bound's concept in xpress's website: [https://www.fico.com/fico-xpress-optimization/docs/dms2019-03/solver/optimizer/HTML/chapter4_sec_section4003.html](https://www.fico.com/fico-xpress-optimization/docs/dms2019-03/solver/optimizer/HTML/chapter4_sec_section4003.html)
2. GAMS's reference for using Xpress in it: [https://www.gams.com/28/docs/S_XPRESS.html#XPRESS_USAGE](https://www.gams.com/28/docs/S_XPRESS.html#XPRESS_USAGE)
3. FICO's website, stating the solver uses b&b for solving MIP [Here](https://www.fico.com/fico-xpress-optimization/docs/latest/solver/optimizer/HTML/chapter4.html?scroll=section4003)
4. For copying gams into cmake: [here](https://www.gams.com/47/docs/API_CPP_TUTORIAL.html#CPP_GETTING_STARTED)
5. In regard to GAMS 25.1 MIP implementation: [here](https://www.gams.com/25.1/docs/UG_ModelSolve.html#UG_ModelSolve_ModelClassificationOfModels_DNLP) and also [this](https://www.gams.com/25.1/docs/UG_LanguageFeatures.html#UG_LanguageFeatures_SpecialMIPFeatures)


#### GAMS in QT
- As you might know, the only "stable" version of GAMS currently available with full solvers support is GAMS 25.1 \*\*for free\*\*, and hence _we are stuck with a very old (probably around 2017 verison) of GAMS_.
- For integration of GAMS inside a QT, you need:
  - visual studio 17 2022 with all c++ sdk and MSVC sdks (The most crucial of all is **`cl.exe`**, which is a command line based MS C++ needed for `CMAKE_COMPILER_CXX` variable)
  - QT 6.7.3
- After cloning the repo I made in [here](https://github.com/amireza007/GAMS28-in-VS-2015), You need to set `CMAKE_GENERATOR` to `Visual Studio 17 2022` and unset `CMAKE_PROJECT_INCLUDE_BEFORE`.
- Then build and enjoy coding in QT!

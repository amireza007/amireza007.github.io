Hello, 

In this post, I'll be posting about my thesis, based on [this](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2022.107968) article, titled **"A conflict free branch and bound approach for scheduling AGVs in ACTs"**. 

I will be using **xpress** for solving the model and GAMS' C++ API for formulating and implementing the B&B approach.

In this page, I will store whatever I think is useful for my defense and thesis needs.

## Useful websites:
1. cool article about Branch and Bound's concept in xpress's website: [https://www.fico.com/fico-xpress-optimization/docs/dms2019-03/solver/optimizer/HTML/chapter4_sec_section4003.html](https://www.fico.com/fico-xpress-optimization/docs/dms2019-03/solver/optimizer/HTML/chapter4_sec_section4003.html)
2. GAMS's reference for using Xpress in it: [https://www.gams.com/28/docs/S_XPRESS.html#XPRESS_USAGE](https://www.gams.com/28/docs/S_XPRESS.html#XPRESS_USAGE)
3. FICO's website, stating the solver uses b&b for solving MIP [Here](https://www.fico.com/fico-xpress-optimization/docs/latest/solver/optimizer/HTML/chapter4.html?scroll=section4003)
4. For copying gams into cmake: [here](https://www.gams.com/47/docs/API_CPP_TUTORIAL.html#CPP_GETTING_STARTED)
5. In regard to GAMS 25.1 MIP implementation: [here](https://www.gams.com/25.1/docs/UG_ModelSolve.html#UG_ModelSolve_ModelClassificationOfModels_DNLP) and also [this](https://www.gams.com/25.1/docs/UG_LanguageFeatures.html#UG_LanguageFeatures_SpecialMIPFeatures)


## GAMS 25.1 in QT
- As you might know, the only "stable" version of GAMS currently available with full solvers support is GAMS 25.1 \*\*for free\*\*, and hence _we are stuck with a very old (probably around 2017 verison) of GAMS_
- _Before doing anything, remember to use **BCUninstaller** to uninstall the Gams and delete its leftovers, then reinstall the 25.1 version with gamslice3.txt as the license.

- For integration of GAMS inside a QT, you need:
  - visual studio 17 2022 with all c++ sdk and MSVC sdks (The most crucial of all is **`cl.exe`**, which is a command line based MS C++ needed for `CMAKE_COMPILER_CXX` variable)
  - QT 6.7.3
- After cloning the repo I made in [here](https://github.com/amireza007/GAMS28-in-VS-2015), You need to set `CMAKE_GENERATOR` to `Visual Studio 17 2022` and unset `CMAKE_PROJECT_INCLUDE_BEFORE`. (alternatively you could set `-DCMAKE_PROJECT_INCLUDE_BEFORE=""` in Qt's `preferences->kits->The-kit->CMake Configuration`)
- Then build and enjoy coding in QT!

**ps**: you might notice a bug in your code when you `#include "gams.h"` saying: `In included file: forward declaration of class cannot have a nested name specifier
gamslib_global.h`. Simply ignore it, because it is related to `clangd`, which is a syntax highlighter thing.

## The AGV Dispatching Conflict-free Article
Enough prerequisites, let's delve into the this article:

 _A branch-and-bound approach for AGV dispatching and routing problems in automated container terminals_ **[doi: [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2022.107968](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2022.107968)]**

### Parameters: 
So **3** types of parameters and sets are used:
- #### Main parameters: 
  These are specific to **AGVs, QCs, Containers, AGV actions**
  - there are several parameters: $$v_{AGV}$$ (the constant speed), $$m$$ (the index of QCs), $$i$$ (index of i-th job of QCs), **$$\alpha$$** (index of AGV actions)
  - There are some Sets regarding to AGVs and QC: **$$C_L, C_D$$** (set of loading and unloading containers), **$$W^V$$**, $$W^H$$ (set of vertical (Horizontal) AGV Actions, $$\alpha$$ = $$2$$($$1,3,4$$) )

- #### Path Related parameters:
  These involve AGV paths:
  - parameters are: $$x_R$$ (width of agv op), $$y_r$$ last vertical **Landside** Area, $$Y_R$$ last **Seaside** Area, $$l$$ (the index of AGVs), $$O_{(m,i)}$$ (vertical path of QC to op $$(m,i)$$), $$A^{L(R)}_{(m,i)}$$ (I don't understand this! _left(Right)-most vertical path of the block that stored container $$(m,i)$$)
  - sets are: $$Y^S$$ (seaside vertical paths), $$Y^L$$ (landside vertical paths), $$X^R$$ (Horizontal paths)
- #### Time related parameters:
  - Parameters are: $$G^Q_{(m,i)}$$ (required time for QC to op $$(m,i)$$), $$G^Y_{(m,i)}$$ (required time for AGV to op $$(m,i)$$ onto AGV-supp),$$S^Q_{(m,i),(m,i+1)}$$ (required time for QC switch)
  - Sets are: **$$\psi _1, \psi _2$$** QC and ASC op schema

### Decision Variables:

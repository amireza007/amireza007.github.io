In this post, I would be talking about branch and bound methods, and implementing an approach tailored for a specific AGV scheduling.

## Interesting insights and concepts: 
In this section, I'll provide some interesting insights or challenging concepts regarding the B&B methods.
### A special of category of B&B algorithms: Alpha-Beta pruning
- In this search algorithm, there are two bounds, namely $$\alpha$$ and $$\beta$$, each are defined to be the minimum (maximum) reward that the maximizing (minimizing) player is assured of. Whenever, $$\alpha \g \beta$$, that branch is **pruned**.

In this post, I would be talking about branch and bound methods, and implementing an approach tailored for a specific AGV scheduling.

## Useful Links and resources: 
- This [Gurobi website](https://www.gurobi.com/resources/mixed-integer-programming-mip-a-primer-on-the-basics/) for basic concepts and terminologies.

## Interesting insights and concepts: 
In this section, I'll provide some interesting insights or challenging concepts regarding the B&B methods.

### Basic concepts
- Def of **Incumbent**: The best integer solution found at any point in the search. [[Gurobi website](https://www.gurobi.com/resources/mixed-integer-programming-mip-a-primer-on-the-basics/)]

### A special of category of B&B algorithms: Alpha-Beta pruning
- In this search algorithm, there are two bounds, namely $$\alpha$$ and $$\beta$$, each are defined to be the minimum (maximum) reward that the maximizing (minimizing) player is assured of. Whenever, $$\alpha > \beta$$, that branch is **pruned**. 

Below is the Pseudo code of the alphabeta pruning:

---
<pre><b>function</b> alphabeta(node, depth, α, β, maximizingPlayer) <b>is</b>
    <b>if</b> depth == 0 <b>or</b> node is terminal <b>then</b>
        <b>return</b> the heuristic value of node
    <b>if</b> maximizingPlayer <b>then</b>
        value&nbsp;:= −∞
        <b>for each</b> child of node <b>do</b>
            value&nbsp;:= max(value, alphabeta(child, depth − 1, α, β, FALSE))
            <b>if</b> value &gt; β <b>then</b>
                <b>break</b> <i>(* β cutoff *)</i>
            α&nbsp;:= max(α, value)
        <b>return</b> value
    <b>else</b>
        value&nbsp;:= +∞
        <b>for each</b> child of node <b>do</b>
            value&nbsp;:= min(value, alphabeta(child, depth − 1, α, β, TRUE))
            <b>if</b> value &lt; α <b>then</b>
                <b>break</b> <i>(* α cutoff *)</i>
            β&nbsp;:= min(β, value)
        <b>return</b> value
</pre>

- In the view of the **Maximizing Player**, this is always the case: `value` $$< \alpha$$ as $$\alpha$$ is always the `α := max(α, value)`. Now, if the `value` $$> \beta $$, it would imply that $$\alpha > \beta$$. Now:
    in the context of B&B algorithm, it would mean that whenever the *lower bound* is *greater* than the *upper bound* of the node, then **prune**. How similar!!

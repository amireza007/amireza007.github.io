In this post, I am talking about a simulation software names "Flexsim", used for simulaiton manufacturing systems and supply chain. I am gonna be posting useful links and tutorials, and I will try to describe the process of making a scenario for the AGV article I am currently studying (the B&B conflict free article!).

## Useful Links:
- DLL maker: [this](https://docs.flexsim.com/en/22.1/Reference/DeveloperAdvancedUser/ConnectingToExternalCode/ConnectingToExternalCode.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## Basics
1. Bottom left corner shows the coordinates when hovering mouse.
2. 

## Important Points to consider:
1. One of the uses for **control points** in the AGV part of flexsim is for **cross sections** where the AGV can perform its **action**.
